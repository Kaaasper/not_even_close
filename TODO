- Time Dilation

- Matted Fur and Dark Pact
-- Show a main stat input for Druid and Warlock
--- Adjust styling to make sure 4 inputs fit on 1 row at all screen sizes
-- Add abilities and new absorb scaling types
-- Calculate AP/SP from main stat. Different for different specs

- Spell Metadata
-- Time between casts
-- Meld/invis/feign nothing/recast/cancel
-- Spell reflect

Not planning on doing for now
- All tank spells
- Physical damage reduced by armor
- Aug mastery: hard to calculate, and nobody plays around it (it's used on cd for dps). Quite powerful tho
- Chrono ward: same as above
- Light's Protection: hard to play around and not really worth it for 2% DR
- Echoing Blessings on Sac: not worth it for 2% DR (32% instead of 30%)
